                <p>Some of the greatest people from the Ancient World came from the city of Athens, amongst them
                    philosophers,
                    artists, writers, and architects. Athens was the birthplace of democracy and also the focus of the
                    Ancient Greek
                    civilization. These are some famous Athenians that you should know.</p>

                <h2>Plato</h2>
                <p>Plato was a student of Socrates. He was born in 429BC into a family that was heavily involved in the
                    politics of
                    Athens. He was given the name ‘Aristocles’ when he was born, but later gained the nickname ‘’Platon’
                    meaning
                    ‘broad’ – a reference to his stature.</p>
                <p>He founded the Academy of Athens which was the first place in the western world to offer students a
                    higher level
                    of education. Many of the famous philosophers studied there. Plato was a great writer, but his
                    writings were in
                    the form of imaginary dialogues. He wrote on many subjects including education, government, logic
                    and justice.
                </p>
                <p>His most famous teaching was the ‘Theory of Forms’ which was seen as controversial at the time. He
                    said that
                    nothing in the world was perfect, but philosophers were searching for ‘perfect knowledge’ which
                    Plato believed
                    could only be achieved by a divine form of god.</p>
                <p>Plato also discussed politics because he felt that people should be chosen for their intellect and
                    good ideas,
                    not their wealth. Plato’s school of philosophy became one of the most important in the world.</p>

                <h2>Socrates</h2>
                <p>Many believe that Socrates was the forerunner of Classical Greek philosophy. He was popular and well
                    known for
                    his wisdom and knowledge. He certainly completely changed the way in which Greeks thought.
                    Unfortunately, his
                    own wisdom led to his demise.</p>

                <p>Socrates believed that education was the key to personal growth and for people to grow, they had to
                    develop
                    their powers of thought rather than learn to things by memory. His thoughts became known as the
                    ‘Socratic
                    Method’ which is still followed today. Socrates was critical of the democratic system as he felt
                    that unskilled
                    and uneducated people should not hold office.</p>

                <p>He enjoyed asking questions of officials that he knew they would be unable to answer – this made him
                    many
                    enemies. He was accused of corrupting the youth of Athens and not believing in the Greek gods. He
                    was found
                    guilty and hanged in 349 BC.</p>
