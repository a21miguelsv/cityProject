                <p>The story of how Athens, one of the oldest cities in the world, attained its current name is a
                    foundational Greek
                    myth.Unbeknownst to many, the city actually had several names throughout its 3,400 years of recorded
                    history.
                    The initial name of Athens was “Coast” or “Aktiki,” and it was taken from the first king of the
                    land, King
                    Aktaio. Afterwards, as the city continued to grow, Aktaio’s successor, King Cecrops, named the city
                    after
                    himself.</p>

                <h2>Origin of the name</h2>
                <p>The name of Athens, connected to the name of its patron goddess Athena, originates from an earlier
                    Pre-Greek
                    language.[1] The origin myth explaining how Athens acquired this name through the legendary contest
                    between
                    Poseidon and Athena was described by Herodotus,[2] Apollodorus,[3] Ovid, Plutarch,[4] Pausanias and
                    others. It
                    even became the theme of the sculpture on the west pediment of the Parthenon. Both Athena and
                    Poseidon requested
                    to be patrons of the city and to give their name to it, so they competed with offering the city one
                    gift each.
                    Poseidon produced a spring by striking the ground with his trident,[5] symbolizing naval power.</p>


                <p>The contest of Athena and Poseidon, West Pediment of the Parthenon
                    Athena created the olive tree, symbolizing peace and prosperity. The Athenians, under their ruler
                    Cecrops,
                    accepted the olive tree and named the city after Athena. (Later the Southern Italian city of Paestum
                    was founded
                    under the name of Poseidonia at about 600 BC.) A sacred olive tree said to be the one created by the
                    goddess was
                    still kept on the Acropolis at the time of Pausanias (2nd century AD).[6] It was located by the
                    temple of
                    Pandrosus, next to the Parthenon. According to Herodotus, the tree had been burnt down during the
                    Persian Wars,
                    but a shoot sprung from the stump. The Greeks saw this as a symbol that Athena still had her mark
                    there on the
                    city.</p>

                <p>Plato, in his dialogue Cratylus, offers his own etymology of Athena's name connecting it to the
                    phrase ἁ θεονόα
                    or hē theoû nóēsis (ἡ θεοῦ νόησις, 'the mind of god').</p>
