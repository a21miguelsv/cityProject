                <p>Athens, Greece, with its famous Acropolis, has come to symbolize the whole of the country in the
                    popular
                    imagination, and not without cause. It not only has its iconic ruins and the famous port of Piraeus
                    but, thanks
                    to ancient writers, its history is better documented than most other ancient Greek city-states.</p>

                <h2>Early Settlement & Legend</h2>
                <p>Evidence of human habitation on the Acropolis and, below, in the area around the agora, dates back to
                    the
                    Neolithic Period with a more advanced culture developing clearly c. 5000 BCE and, probably, as early
                    as 7000
                    BCE. According to legend, the Athenian King Cecrops wanted the city named for himself but the gods,
                    seeing how
                    beautiful it was, felt it deserved an immortal name. A contest was held among the gods on the
                    Acropolis, with
                    Cecrops and the citizenry looking on, to determine which deity would win the honor.</p>

                <p>Poseidon struck a rock with his trident, and as water gushed forth, he assured the people that now
                    they would
                    never suffer drought. Athena was next in line and dropped a seed into the earth which sprouted
                    swiftly as an
                    olive tree. The people thought the olive tree more valuable than the water (as, according to some
                    versions of
                    the story, the water was salty, as was Poseidon's realm), and Athena was chosen as patron and the
                    city named for
                    her. According to scholar Robin Waterfield:</p>
                <blockquote>This myth may reveal long-forgotten historical events. The ancient Greek name for Athens is
                    a plural
                    word, because once there were several villages which came together under the auspices of the goddess
                    Athena –
                    “the communities of Athena” – as it were. If the chief deity of one of these original villages was
                    Poseidon, the
                    myth reflects his losing out to Athena.</blockquote>

                </figure>
                <p>The myth was also used, later, to justify the second-class status of Athenian women since it was the
                    women of
                    Athens who chose Athena’s gift over Poseidon’s and, so this justification goes, to turn away
                    Poseidon’s wrath
                    from the city, women’s names were not recorded on birth records as mothers (the woman’s father’s
                    name was given)
                    and women were denied a political voice and civic rights outside of their participation in religious
                    activities.
                </p>
                <p>As the soil was not conducive to large-scale agricultural programs, Athens turned to trade for its
                    livelihood and
                    mainly to sea trade through its port at Piraeus. The early Mycenaean period saw massive fortresses
                    rise all over
                    Greece, and Athens was no exception. The remains of a Mycenaean palace can still be seen today on
                    the Acropolis
                    in the present day. Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey (8th century BCE) portray the Mycenaeans as great
                    warriors and
                    seafaring people trading widely throughout the Aegean and the Mediterranean region, and this became
                    a point of
                    pride for the Athenians who considered themselves direct descendants of the great Homeric heroes.

                <p>Around 1200 BCE the Sea Peoples invaded the Greek archipelago of the Aegean from the south while,
                    simultaneously,
                    the Dorians came down from the north into mainland Greece. While the Sea Peoples made definite
                    incursions into
                    Attica (the mainland region surrounding Athens) the Dorians bypassed the city, allowing the
                    Mycenaean culture to
                    survive (although, like the rest of Greece, there seems to have been an economic and cultural
                    downturn following
                    these invasions during the Bronze Age Collapse). The Athenians, afterward, claimed for themselves a
                    special
                    status in that they spoke Ionian, instead of Doric, Greek and held to customs they felt were more
                    ancient and
                    therefore superior to those of their neighbors.</p>
