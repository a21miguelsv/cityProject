    <h2>Acropolis Hill and the Parthenon</h2>
    <p>One of the most popular sites and sights in the world, the iconic Parthenon, is dominating the heart of Athens.
        Just a look at this historical landmark is enough to impress you! The great monument of the Parthenon is a
        symbol of Greece, of Democracy and all the values the Ancient Greek civilization represented. A visit to Athens
        cannot be considered a proper visit without a tour of the Acropolis and it is on the top of the list for all
        first-time travelers to the Greek capital. The Parthenon, the temple of the virgin goddess, Athena, is not the
        only monument of great value on the rock of Acropolis. There are many impressive buildings on the site, like the
        Erechtheion with the famous Caryatids (which is, actually, the most sacred building on Acropolis), the Temple of
        Athena Nike and the impressive Propylaea. Traveling on the rock of Acropolis is like traveling back in time. The
        place that was closely associated with some of the most important mythological stories is the ideal place to
        enjoy a mythology tour and discover the mindset of the people that built this unique monument. The view from the
        top of Acropolis Hill is also breathtaking. The whole city of Athens is at your feet but at the same time, you
        feel like you are in another area, far away from the hustle and bustle of the modern city. For a more complete
        experience, you should combine your visit to the Acropolis site with a tour of the new Acropolis Museum, which
        is located at the base of the Hill. The museum exhibits all the artifacts that were found on Acropolis during
        the excavations and it will complete your understanding of the role of Acropolis in the lives of the Ancient
        Athenians.</p>

    <h2>Panathenaic Stadium</h2>
    <p>This landmark of Athens is located next to the Temple of Olympian Zeus. It is the stage of the first Modern
        Olympic Games! Being the only stadium in the world built entirely of marble, the Panathenaic Stadium is located
        on top of an ancient stadium that was used primarily for the Panathenaic Games. The Olympic Hymn was heard for
        the first time in this stadium and it is the finishing line of the authentic Athens Classic Marathon. The
        Ancient Greeks had the saying “Nous hugieis en somati hugiei”, meaning “healthy mind in healthy body”. Sports
        and sports competitions were a huge part of their life and this stadium was a symbol of unity for all Athenians
        as its name suggests (Pan-Athenaic, “all Athenians”).</p>

    <h2>Temple of Hephaestus</h2>
    <p>Another great monument of Athens that you should not miss. The Temple of Hephaestus is located inside the Ancient
        Agora and it is actually one of the best-preserved temples of Greek antiquity. In the beginning, there was a
        misconception about this landmark since the archaeologists considered it a temple dedicated to the Athenian hero
        Theseus. Scenes of the heroes’ labors on the metopes of the temple led to this misconception. Later findings,
        however, proved that this was a temple dedicated actually to the god of blacksmiths and craftsmen, Hephaestus.
        The goddess of wisdom, Athena, was also worshipped in this temple, with her bronze statue positioned just next
        to the one of Hephaestus, as described by the ancient traveler and geographer Pausanias. Unfortunately, the
        statues of the gods were never found, but the outside of the temple is really worth a visit! If you pay close
        attention, you will be able to see scenes from the labors of Hercules at the metopes of its east side, while the
        metopes of its south side depict scenes from the labors of Theseus. The misconception of the figure that was
        worshipped in this temple led to the ‘false’ naming of the surrounding area, which is still called Thesseio,
        after Theseus. From this monument, you can admire clear views of the Acropolis Hill and in the surrounding area,
        you will find small traders and craftsmen, selling their handmade creations in the same place for more than 2000
        years!</p>
